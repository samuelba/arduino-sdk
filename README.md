# Arduino SDK

This is the Arduino SDK (Version 1.6.5-r5) without the Arduino IDE. This repository contains only files that are 
required to work with [arduino-cmake](https://github.com/queezythegreat/arduino-cmake).

## Install

run

    sudo ./install.sh
    
## Remarks

Additionally to the 'official' Arduino devices, this repository contains also the board and pin definitions for 
the Sparkfun Pro Micro 16MHz.
